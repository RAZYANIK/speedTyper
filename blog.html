                    <p class="card-text text-white">Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. In
                        JavaScript, there are 3 types of variable scope, namely: Global
                        Scope,
                        Function Scope and
                        Block Scope. <br>
                        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of
                        the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the curly brackets {}.

                        Imagine a nested situation:
                        A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block variables. ES6 introduced
                        two
                        important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

                        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

                        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.
                        <br>
                        Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

                        Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

                        Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

                        They all have Global Scope. he variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
                        known as global variables
                        and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.

                    <h5 class="card-title text-info">How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text text-white">We’ll start with a somewhat of an odd claim — despite allowing async
                        JavaScript code (like the setTimeout we just discussed), until ES6, JavaScript itself has
                        actually never had any direct notion of asynchronicity built into it. The JavaScript engine has
                        never done anything more than executing a single chunk of your program at any given moment.<br>
                        <i>So what is the event loop after all?</i> <br>
                        The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                        Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                        the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                        Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                        callback.<br>
                        It’s interesting to note that ES6 specifies how the event loop should work, meaning that
                        technically it’s within the scope of the JS engine’s responsibilities, which is no longer
                        playing just a hosting environment role. One main reason for this change is the introduction of
                        Promises in ES6 because the latter require access to a direct, fine-grained control over
                        scheduling operations on the event loop queue (we’ll discuss them in a greater detail later).

                        undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The
                        initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.<br>
